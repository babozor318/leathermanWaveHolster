=====================

LeatherMan Wave Multitool Belt Holster inspired by Adam Savage from Mythbusters / Tested http://www.tested.com/art/makers/461173-one-day-builds-adams-custom-multi-tool-belt-holster/

Initial design contains every iteration of the project, in 3dm (rhino 5 3d files) and STL files to be able to print it...

Result
See pictures for the result, printed on a PrintrBot Simple Metal with white PLA...
On the inner groove, the plastic has a tendency to run, but it's a good thing (for once) it makes the result thighter on the multi-tool and still easy to remove with one hand.

Future improvements...
I have make a belt thingy, i need to put holes in the main structure and to make a few tweaks here and there.
